# Project Progress Log

**Purpose**: Append-only session log tracking all major decisions, implementations, and milestones.

**Format**: Each session appends a new entry with date, summary, decisions, and next steps.

**Instructions**:
- At the end of each session (after /compact), append a new entry
- Keep entries concise (200-300 words max)
- Focus on: code changes, architecture decisions, model behavior, blockers

## Session 2026-02-14 - Initial Setup

**Date**: 2026-02-14
**Duration**: Initial setup
**Participants**: Claude Code

**Summary**:
Initialized F1 Complete Race Strategy Optimizer project with comprehensive documentation structure. Created persistent project memory system following modular context approach.

**Completed**:
- ✅ Created CLAUDE.md as single source of truth (≤5000 tokens)
- ✅ Established docs/ directory with modular documentation:
  - docs/data.md: Data sources, splits, management (comprehensive)
  - docs/models.md: ML architectures, training, validation
  - docs/architecture.md: System design, deployment, infrastructure
  - docs/metrics.md: KPIs, targets, validation criteria
  - docs/monitoring.md: Operational monitoring, alerting, runbooks
  - docs/roadmap.md: 13-week timeline, phases, milestones
- ✅ Initialized docs/progress.md (this file) and session_summary.md
- ✅ Set up branch: claude/f1-strategy-optimizer-lh9No

**Key Decisions**:
1. **Modular Documentation**: Large content separated into specialized docs/ files rather than bloating CLAUDE.md
2. **Tech Stack Confirmed**: GCP (BigQuery, Dataflow, Cloud Run, Vertex AI) for integrated ecosystem
3. **4-Model Architecture**: Tire degradation (XGBoost), Fuel consumption (LSTM), Brake bias (LinReg), Driving style (DecisionTree)
4. **Temporal Split Strategy**: 1950-2022 train, 2023 Q1-Q2 val, 2023 Q3-Q4 + 2024 test (prevents data leakage)
5. **Success Metrics**: Podium ≥70%, Winner ≥65%, API P99 <500ms, Cost <$0.001/prediction

**Architecture Highlights**:
- Data Layer: Ergast API (1950-2024) + FastF1 (2018-2024, 10Hz telemetry)
- Feature Store: BigQuery partitioned by race_date
- ML Layer: 4 specialized models + Monte Carlo simulator (10K scenarios)
- Serving: FastAPI on Cloud Run with <500ms P99 latency target
- Monitoring: Cloud Monitoring with 6 alert policies

**Known Bottlenecks Identified**:
- 🔴 Monte Carlo simulation (10K scenarios) → Mitigation: GPU acceleration, reduce to 5K live
- 🔴 Real-time inference latency → Mitigation: Model caching, quantization (FP32→INT8)
- 🔴 API response time target → Mitigation: Cloud Run autoscaling, load testing
- 🟠 Model training compute → Mitigation: Vertex AI distributed training

**Hard Constraints**:
- Telemetry only 2018+ (earlier races have partial data)
- Budget: ~$200-250/month GCP spend
- P99 latency must be <500ms (pit wall requirement)
- Uptime 99.5% during race weekends

**Next Steps**:
1. Commit and push documentation structure to branch
2. Run setup.sh to configure GCP project
3. Begin data ingestion (Ergast + FastF1 download)
4. Create BigQuery schema and raw tables
5. Start driver profile extraction (Week 3-4)

**Blockers**: None

**Notes**:
- Repository structure aligns with specification
- All documentation cross-referenced for easy navigation
- Session hygiene protocol established (append to progress.md after /compact)
- Compaction discipline: Every ~40 messages, run /compact

## Session Template (Future Entries)

**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Duration**: X hours
**Participants**: Team members

**Summary**:
[Brief overview of session work]

**Completed**:
- [ ] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2

**Key Decisions**:
1. Decision 1 with rationale
2. Decision 2 with rationale

**Code Changes**:
- File: path/to/file.py - Description

**Model Behavior**:
- Model X: Accuracy Y on test set

**Next Steps**:
1. Next action 1
2. Next action 2

**Blockers**: [Any issues]

**Notes**: [Additional context]

**End of Progress Log**

**Instructions for Future Sessions**:
1. After running `/compact`, append a new session entry above this line
2. Include date, summary, completed tasks, decisions, next steps
3. Keep entries focused on high-signal information (code, architecture, model behavior)
4. Avoid repeating information already in CLAUDE.md or docs/ files
5. Reference files instead of restating content
